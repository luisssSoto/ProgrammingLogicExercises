# Programming Logic Exercises

## __Welcome to my repository__

### This repository contains several exercises from [Hacker Rank, Code Signal, Code Wars, LeetCode ](https://www.hackerrank.com, https://codesignal.com, https://www.codewars.com, https://leetcode.com/) each directory has a lot of exercises sort by complexity level and in different programming languages (only in js and python yet), but the structure is similar to each exercise:
* A file .py or .js (code with the possible solution)
* A file .txt (exercise's intructions)
* A file .png (The evidence that the code works and in some cases the Complexity Analysis)
