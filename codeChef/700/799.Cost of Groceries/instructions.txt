Explanation:
Test case 
1
1: Item 
2
2 has freshness value greater than equal to 
X
=
20
X=20. Thus, Chef buys item 
2
2. The total cost is 
90
90.

Test case 
2
2: Items 
1
,
2
,
1,2, and 
3
3 have freshness value greater than equal to 
X
=
1
X=1. Thus, Chef buys all 
3
3 items. The total cost is 
1
+
2
+
3
=
6
1+2+3=6.

Test case 
3
3: No item has freshness value greater than equal to 
X
=
100
X=100. Thus, Chef buys no items.

Test case 
4
4: Items 
2
2 and 
3
3 have freshness value greater than equal to 
X
=
50
X=50. Thus, Chef buys items 
2
2 and 
3
3. The total cost is 
30
+
20
=
50
30+20=50.
