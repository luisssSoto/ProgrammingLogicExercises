Largest and Second Largest
You are given an array 
A
A of 
N
N integers.
Find the maximum sum of two distinct integers in the array.

Note: It is guaranteed that there exist at least two distinct integers in the 
array.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains single integer 
N
N — the size of the array.
The next line contains 
N
N space-separated integers, denoting the array 
A
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the maximum sum of two distinct 
integers in the array.
