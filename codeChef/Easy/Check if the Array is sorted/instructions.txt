Check if the array is sorted
Given an array nums, return true if the array was initially sorted in 
non-decreasing order and then rotated any number of times (including zero). 
Otherwise, return false.

Rotation means that some prefix of the array is moved to the end while 
maintaining the relative order of all elements.
Duplicates are allowed in the array.

Note:
If A is the original sorted array and it is rotated by k positions, the 
resulting array B satisfies:
B[i] = A[(i+k) % A.length] for every valid index i.

Constraints
1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

Sample 1:
Input
Output
7
6 7 1 2 3 4 5
true
Explanation:
The original sorted array was [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].
Rotating by k = 2 positions gives [6,7,1,2,3,4,5].

Sample 2:
Input
Output
5
2 3 4 5 1
true
Explanation:
The original sorted array [1,2,3,4,5] rotated by k = 4 results in [2,3,4,5,1].

Sample 3:
Input
Output
5
4 5 2 3 1
false
Explanation:
No rotation of a sorted array can produce this order.
