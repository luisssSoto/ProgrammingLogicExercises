'''
1.
input: integer array
output: integer number which represents all the indexes that don't match
heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
output: 3

2.
edge cases: increasing order return 0
key: it is not neccessary to sort the array only compare it with 
the sorted array and keep track of all the indexes that don't match
with the sorted array

3. 
sort_heights = sort(heights)
conditional statement if sort_heights == to heights if so return 0
else
    for loop in order to iterate each element with the sorted heights
        conditional statement to know if n element is different to its contrapart if so
            then add 1 to the count variable
return the count variable
