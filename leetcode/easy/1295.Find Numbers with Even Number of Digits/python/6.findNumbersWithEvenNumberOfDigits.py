'''Complexity Analysis:
Time complexity: O(N . log(M))
Where M is each num in nums because we cast each num into String
Then we perform a loop of each num: O(N)
Where N is nums
Space complexity: We are using constant extra space. Hence, the space complexity is O(1).

'''Complexity Analysis:
Time complexity: O(N . log(M))
When dividing an integer x by y, there can be at most O(log y(x)) divisions: O(log M)
Where M is each num in nums
Then we perform a loop of each num: O(N)
Where N is nums
Space complexity: We are using constant extra space. Hence, the space complexity is O(1).
